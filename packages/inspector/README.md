# @act-spec/inspector

Inspector CLI + library for the ACT (Agent Content Tree) wire format.
Subcommands: `fetch`, `walk`, `diff`, `token-budget`. The binary is
`act-inspect`; the library exposes one programmatic function per
subcommand.

Two architectural invariants drive the design:

- Every envelope this package sees passes through `@act-spec/validator`'s
  per-envelope validators. The inspector never ships its own JSON Schema
  parser.
- The inspector emits `findings` — user-facing observations — never
  `gaps`. For a conformance verdict, run `act-validate`
  (`@act-spec/validator`).

## Status

ACT v0.1 internal hand-test candidate. Public release lands at v0.2.

## Install

Unpublished in v0.1. Consume via the workspace:

```jsonc
// package.json
{ "devDependencies": { "@act-spec/inspector": "workspace:*" } }
```

For out-of-tree hand-test, run `pnpm pack` inside `packages/inspector`
and install the resulting tarball locally; the `act-inspect` binary is
exposed via the package's `bin` field.

## Usage

CLI:

```bash
act-inspect fetch  https://example.com/act/                # manifest + index summary
act-inspect walk   https://example.com/act/  --max 50       # walk N nodes
act-inspect diff   ./before/index.json ./after/index.json   # ETag-keyed diff
act-inspect token-budget https://example.com/act/  --limit 8000
```

Programmatic:

```ts
import { inspect, walk, diff, budget, node, subtree } from '@act-spec/inspector';

const result = await inspect({ url: 'https://example.com/act/' });
for (const finding of result.findings) {
  console.log(finding.code, finding.message);
}
```

## Conformance / what's tested

Each subcommand has a citing test in the suite covering the validator-reuse
invariant, the `findings` reporting contract, etag-keyed diff semantics,
and the token-budget walk policy. The conformance gate exercises every
subcommand against the bundled fixtures.

```bash
pnpm -F @act-spec/inspector conformance
```

## Compatibility

Pure JS, no host-framework peer. Targets Node 20+. Reuses the schema
bundle and per-envelope validators shipped by `@act-spec/validator`;
upgrading the validator picks up new schema versions automatically.
